## Usage

You can find your IP address on the status bar. Simply click on it to iterate thru all IP addresses.

To insert IP address into the text,

* Bring up Command Palette (`F1`, or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux, or `Shift+CMD+P` on OSX)
* Type or select "Insert IP Address"

You can also modify keyboard shortcut with JSON below.
```json
{
  "key": "alt+shift+i",
  "command": "ipAddress.insertIPAddress",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

You can alsoe insert the selected IP address into a configuration from `launch.json` or `tasks.json` using [input variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference#_input-variables). For instance here for a `tasks.json` echoing the selection in the terminal:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "echo selected host ip",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "echo 'selected host ip ${input:hostIP}'"
    },
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "command",
      "id": "hostIP",
      "command": "ipAddress.getSelectedIPAddress"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Public IP address

Public IP address is obtained from OpenDNS via [`check-ip`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/public-ip) and updated every minute.

Query public IP address will require sending packets to the Internet and we want to minimize the network traffic. If the public IP address is not shown in the status bar, we will not update the IP address. And even if it is shown, we will not update it more than once every minute.
